gDao
====
This is a generic dao for spring-hibernate combination. It comes with spring and hibernate dependencies so you don't have to add those dependencies yourself. This also provides the perfect compatibility between versions.

Best feauture of this generic dao is the "SimpleDao" annotation. If you are content with the generic functions of gDao you don't have to create the dao class of the model. For more explanation and usages, see wiki.
